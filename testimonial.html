                "When I was in college, I really wanted to work in the music industry,
                but I wasn’t sure how to get in. After asking around, I was introduced to Monet,
                the founder of Future Executives, inc. through a friend. At the time,
                she was working at Penalty Records and they thought she would be a good
                contact for me. She hired me as her intern and introduced me to a whole new world.
                After twelve years of being in this business, I can honestly say it was being under
                Monet’s tutelage that helped me get to where I am today. Not only did she teach me the basics,
                but she also introduced me to many of the biggest players in the game.
                Monet taught me executives skills and was always there to guide me.  I will always appreciate that about her."

              <br>
              <p>The experience with Marsha, co-founder of  Future Executives, Inc., as my mentor
                came as I was an intern with Elektra Entertainment Group. Many in the mentor role
                don’t fully grasp the importance of their position. I was fortunate that Marsha not
                only gave me guidance in my day to day duties but was a constant example and if
                I can say Co-Pilot in my overall growth with the company and my career as a whole.</p>
              <br>
              <p>As a woman in business, I believe it is important to be an example to future business women.
                Whether it was breaking down marketing plans or breaking down the office politics, my mentor / mentee experience
                was invaluable and a relationship that I treasure to this day.""</p>

                "My name is Johanna Rios and I had the honor of having Ms. Wahls,
                Founder of Future Executives, Inc., as a teacher and adviser was my
                teacher and adviser for 4 years. She is someone who I will always
                remember from my time in E.B.C. High school.  She was a teacher and a
                friend that was there for me no matter what. Ms. Wahls was tough and
                made me see that life has many great options based upon your perception.
                She was not like other teachers who came to work just to received a pay check,
                she put her time and effort into her students. She taught me how to be independent
                and fight for what I believe is right. Ms. Wahls after graduating from E.B.C. over
                7 years ago, we are still in contact.  She took us to places like MTV and fancy restaurants
                where we as an advisory group enjoyed outside social time and exposed us to the finer things
                in life and left me with so many memories and life long lessons.  I always happily reflect back on my time with her."

                Ms. Wahls while I attended High School. She was such a down to earth teacher,
                which you don’t always come across these days. I interned for her when I was a
                sophomore, performed in her production of “The Dance Never Stopped” and she
                was my coach for our school step team during my junior year. Working with her
                was a pleasure because she make you feel your opinions matter.  She is someone
                that appreciates and incorporates the ideas of others into what she does.  You
                can always expect to see her modeling  and teaching the skills needed to be a Future Executive."
